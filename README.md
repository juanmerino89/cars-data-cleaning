# Cars data cleaning

In this repository, I cleaned the files from the folder [data](https://github.com/juanmerino89/cars-data-cleaning/blob/main/data_cars/). These files, in extension xlsx, are coming from a web scraping of Cars.com.
The extraction was done with Power Automate.

The data cleaning it's included in the notebook [CarsDataCleaning](https://github.com/juanmerino89/cars-data-cleaning/blob/main/CarsDataCleaning.ipynb).

Check the final [cleaned file](https://github.com/juanmerino89/cars-data-cleaning/blob/main/cars.csv).

## Thank you!
